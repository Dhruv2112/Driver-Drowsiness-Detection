This repository contains the code for a Driver Drowsiness Detection system implemented using Deep Learning. The goal of this project is to enhance road safety by detecting signs of driver drowsiness in real-time and alerting the driver to prevent potential accidents.
Real-time facial landmark detection and tracking
Eyes state classification (Open/Closed)
Drowsiness prediction using a pre-trained deep neural network
Auditory and visual alerts for the drive
